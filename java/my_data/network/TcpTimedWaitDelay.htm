 the time that must elapse before TCP can release a closed connection 
and reuse its resources. This interval between closure and release is 
known as the TIME_WAIT state or 2MSL state. During this time, the 
connection can be reopened at much less cost to the client and server 
than establishing a new connection.</p> <p>RFC&nbsp;793 requires that TCP 
maintains a closed connection for an interval at least equal to twice 
the maximum segment lifetime (2MSL) of the network. When a connection is
 released, its socket pair and TCP control block (TCB) can be used to 
support another connection. By default, the MSL is defined to be 
120&nbsp;seconds, and the value of this entry is equal to two MSLs, or 
4&nbsp;minutes. However, you can use this entry to customize the interval.</p> <p>Reducing
 the value of this entry allows TCP to release closed connections 
faster, providing more resources for new connections. However, if the 
value is too low, TCP might release connection resources before the 
connection is complete, requiring the server to use additional resources
 to reestablish the connection.</p> <p> <img alt="Note Image" src="Cc938217.reskit_note(en-us,TechNet.10).gif"> Note</p> <p>Normally,
 TCP does not release closed connections until the value of this entry 
expires. However, TCP can release connections before this value expires 
if it is running out of TCP control blocks (TCBs). The number of TCBs 
the system creates is specified by the value of the
